    <string name="about_leaves_changing_color">Of all the natural processes around us, the annual changing of
        leaves from green to different shades of yellow, orange, and red is perhaps the most beautiful. But behind this show of color,
        there are important scientific processes at work.\nWant to give your child a peek into the science behind a tree\'s
        changing leaves? With this hands-on activity, you\'ll show how those colors stay hidden in the leaf all year long!</string>
    <string name ="requirement4a">3 leaves(from the same tree)\nRubbing Alcohol\nJar\nPlastic baggie (or plastic wrap)
        \nPaper Coffee Filter\nSmall bowl or pan</string>
    <string name ="steps4a">1.  Have your child break the leaves into tiny pieces and put in the jar.
        \n2.  Pour rubbing alcohol over the leaves until they are just covered.
        \n3.  Mash and stir the leaves into the rubbing alcohol until the alcohol turns slightly green.
        Really give it a good mashing â€“ this is key.</string>
    <string name="steps4a4">4.  Cover the jar with the baggie or plastic wrap and place the jar in a
        small bowl and pour hot water into the bowl.</string>
    <string name="steps4a5">5.  Leave the jar in the water for 30 minutes, swishing the jar occasionally to stir the leaves a bit.
        The alcohol should be a very dark green (leave longer if needed). If you can resist, wait even 45 minutes or an hour.
        \n6.  Cut a strip in the coffee filter so the strip can reach the rubbing alcohol. Place it in the jar like this:</string>
    <string name="steps4a7">7.  The liquid will travel up the coffee filter and the colours will separate as the alcohol
        evaporates off the coffee filter. Let this happen for about an hour for the full effect. The leaves we used
        turn to a beautiful yellow in autumn.</string>
    <string name="steps4afinal">this science experiment we used the rubbing alcohol and energy (hot water) to separate the colours.
        You likely saw green, and depending on your leaf type, maybe red, yellow, or orange. As we know, Chlorophyll gives leaves
        their green colour and is so dominant it hides the other colours in the leaves.  But in the fall, chlorophyll in the leaves
        breaks down allowing the other colours to finally shine through and show their beautiful reds, yellows, and oranges.</string>
